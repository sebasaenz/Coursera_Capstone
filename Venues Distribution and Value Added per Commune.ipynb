As a porte\u00f1o (born and raised in Buenos Aires) I can state that there are quite some prejudices and preconceptions about the relation between particular areas of the city and the quality of life that their residents have, therefore it's interesting to have some statistical and data science insights to contrast this ideas and contribute with some new knowledge about it.\n\nI consider this problem particularly relevant because hopefully it will give some light about an important topic that can help businesses to make decisions towards choosing a particular type of public and dediding a particular geographic location in order to address in a better way their customers' requests."
